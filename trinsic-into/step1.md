The Trinsic CLI is a tool that allows you to interact with our cloud api and manage everything from wallets to templates to verifiable credentials and proofs.

It is released as part of the [Trinsc SDK](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/releases), and has been installed by default in this environment.

To use it type the

`trinsic`{{execute}}

command.

You should see a basic output describing the tool and options available to use.

There are multiple sub commands with a variety of functionality. We will be exploring only a fraction of them in this demo. After you are done we encourage you to download the CLI for your platform and contine to explore the Trinsic API.
